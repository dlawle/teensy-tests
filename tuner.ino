//This code is made using the very good sine wave freq detection by Amanda Ghassaei july 2012
//https://www.instructables.com/member/amandaghassaei/
//it is then put into the loop and the lights just light up when its there turn.

//this is just a suggestion of what to put on the arduino. you can put anything you want!
//remember this is made by sam the dumbest coder on the planet.
//but it works! you cant dispute that haha.
//this is just a suggestion of what to put on the arduino. you can put anything you want!
//maybe something that rotates to the frequency? no ones saying you need a tuner haha.
//if anyone makes a different sketch they think is superior and want to share also definitely share
//there are a lot of free pins on the nano. maybe you could add a suboctave generator or something!
//just some ideas
//it is made to be quite accomadating for analog oscillators, it's probably best to fine track the oscillator
//with another tuner with more accuracy, this gives a ball park figure for gigs. and it works just fine
//for that!
